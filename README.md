### ðŸ”¦HighConcept

â€˜â€™Corpo-seco is a story of Julia, an investigator, who receives a handwritten letter about her parents' disappearance and lack of information. She decided to delve deeply into this mystery and went to the origins of all the information she'd gathered, a distinct mansion far away from everything and everything. She never quite understood what happened, and finding out the truth is her only goal.
